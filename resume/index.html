              <li>Filtered an expansive data set with over 50,000 data points on League of Legends and created meaningful visualizations of data to simplify viewing and understanding.</li>
              <li>Performed multiple data analysis techniques such as Univariate and Bivariate analysis to emphasize significance of the filtered data.</li>
              <li>Performed a hypothesis test on filtered data set and created a Baseline Model to predict outcomes based on the given data.</li>
              <li>Refined the Baseline Model, increasing the accuracy and efficiency by 10%, and performed a Fairness Evaluation on the model to rule out potential biases.</li>
